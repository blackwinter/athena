= athena - Convert database files to various formats

== VERSION

This documentation refers to athena version 0.2.4


== DESCRIPTION

Athena is a library to convert "database" files between various formats.
It's accompanied by a corresponding executable that gives access to its
converting features from the command-line. See Athena::Formats for the
supported database formats and how you can add your own.

=== Plugins

Athena has a plugin system that allows you to implement additional database
formats and have them available easily. Just create a file +athena_plugin.rb+
(Athena::PLUGIN_FILENAME) in your Gem's +lib+ directory or any directory that's
placed in <tt>$LOAD_PATH</tt>. See Athena::Formats on how to define custom formats.
